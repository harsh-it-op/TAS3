# Python Math Operations Repository

This repository contains two Python programs that demonstrate mathematical operations:

## Task 1: Factorial Calculation
- File: `factorial.py`
- Functionality:
  - Calculates the factorial of a given number using iteration
  - Handles edge cases (0, 1, and negative numbers)
  - Includes a sample test with the number 5

## Task 2: Math Module Operations
- File: `math_operations.py`
- Functionality:
  - Takes user input for a number
  - Uses Python's math module to calculate:
    - Square root
    - Natural logarithm (base e)
    - Sine value (in radians)
  - Displays formatted results
